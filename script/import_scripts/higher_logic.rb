  #
  # Discourse has category_groups, which could probably give them some of the functionality of the closed, invitation-only communities.
  # It also has a set number of "autogroups", one of which is 'trust_level_0' for Authenticated only, and would give them more than the
  # binary of 'read_restricted'.
  #
  # CommunityMember also has information about subscriptions and email addresses, which they were interested in keeping,
  # and could possibly map with Discourse's category_users.

  ### DiscussionPost --> Post
  # Primary key: we've chosen MessageID, because it can be sorted in a more predictable order than MessageKey
  # Topics get created with the same method as posts, based on the post not having a 'topic_id' attribute
  # Topics must belong to a category, and must have a title
  # Posts must belong to a topic
  # The automagical topic grouping is the least understood (by me) part of the magic import scripts
  # The original script didn't have a way to detect the topic for a reply-to-a-reply,
  #   because the ParentMessageID points to the direct parent,
  #   but does not point to the topic.
  # I have modified the script to attempt finding the imported topic from the imported parent, and assign it to the n-th reply.
  # Oddities: Discourse is allegedly flat, but it successfully detected nested replies within the largest thread I could find"
